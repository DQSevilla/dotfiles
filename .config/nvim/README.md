# nvim

My neovim config, basically a modular version of kickstart.nvim but with my own flare

## Deps

## TODO

- [ ] Spelling
  - [X] Spelling suggestions: z=
  - [ ] Determine when to turn `spell` on and add a toggle
  - [ ] Adding words to personal dictionary
- [ ] Tree-sitter (for telescope as well
- [ ] Sortcut for opening diagnostics window
- [ ] `gq` LSP formatting shortcut
- [ ] Mason for installint linters and formatters too??

## To Learn

- Practice with motions using / and f and t. e.g. d2t<character> and d/<searchterm>
- Code folding
  - Maybe just look into a plugin like nvim-ufo though
